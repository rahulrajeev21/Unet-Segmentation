# U-Net: Segmentation using Deep Learning

In the past few years, a number of neural networks for image segmentation we re designed with considerable success. One of the most prominent attempts was the U-Net by Ronneberger et al. (2015) [1]. The network follows a symmetric shape in its architecture, from which it gets its name.
